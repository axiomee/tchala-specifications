ABOUT OFFICIAL EXAMS
One of the biggest priorities of Haitian students is the official exams. So the main goal of Tchala is to train them for those exams by  providing questions that occurred in previous official exams. Those questions will be posted by the community and rated by the community, for the community.
But we don't plan on creating Tchala just for high school students, we believe it can be a great asset to everyone in the education field.
On the days of official exams, if users are near an exam center, they won't be able to access the website. An efficient way to prevent cheating.

ABOUT THE "JUST LIKE IN TRIVIA CRACK"
We don't plan to copy Trivia Crack (not at all), we just think the developers did a great job on this app and since it's 
related to Tchala, we (shamelessly) build some of our app features around theirs.

NOTE FROM THE HAICKERS TEAM
We did our best to write those specifications, but if you think we're missing something or one of those ideas lack foundations, simply contact our team leader at r4meau@gmail.com.
Cheers,
Haickers.
